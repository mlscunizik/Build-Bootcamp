Tutor: [Akeem Qudus](https://github.com/holytech) and [Nehemiah Onyekachukwu Emmanuel](https://github.com/devgenix)<br>
The goal of this course is to introduce you to get started using git and github comfortably to work effectively.üöÄ

## Periquisities
If you followed from week 1, then you know what a repository is and why it's necessary to use git and github. <br>
The guide in the module uses git commands and not the Github Desktop GUI. If you use the Windows OS, please use Git Bash (or Power Shell) and not Command Prompt. Git Bash is installed alongside when you install Git, if you don't have Git installed yet, download it for Windows from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). <br>
If you use Linux or Mac, use the Terminal. First make sure Git is installed by running the command ```git --version```. if you get an output like below, <br>

then you have git installed. Otherwise if you get an error like ```-bash: git: command not found```, then install git with the command ```sudo apt install git```<br>

For a further guide on how to install Git on Windows, Mac or Linux; check [here](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/)<br><br>
With that out of the way, let's get started.

## Git init
To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new main branch. 

#### Creating a new git repository an existing project.

‚Ä¢ Open your CLI (Command Line
Interface) <br>
‚Ä¢ Navigate into the project
directory. <br>
‚Ä¢ Type ‚Äúgit init‚Äù and hit
enter. <br>

<b>On Windows;</b> <br>
‚Ä¢ Open the project directory in your in
your file explorer (Windows) or finder
(Mac). <br>
‚Ä¢ Right click in the folder, click ‚Äúgit bash
here‚Äù (Windows) or ‚Äúopen terminal
here‚Äù (Mac). <br>
‚Ä¢ Type ‚Äúgit init‚Äù and hit enter. <br>

## Git Clone
If a project has already been set up in a central repository, the clone command is the most common way for users to get a local copy they can work on.
