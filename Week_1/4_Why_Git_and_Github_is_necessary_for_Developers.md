In 2018, GitHub was acquired by Microsoft for a whopping $7.5B dollars. Briefly, we'll state some reasons why developers love and use GitHub so much, and why you should use it too
GitHub hosts 85M code repositories and has 28M users, which is more than the population of Australia. In this article, we will find out exactly why GitHub is so popular.
GitHub is the worldâ€™s largest software development platform. It provides cloud storage for source code and supports all popular programming languages. The technology at it's core, Git, is a Version Control System which controls revisions and runs in the command line interface.

## The Why.

Here are a few reasons why Git and Github is widely used and necessary for Developers.

**1. 'Show-proof'**

Assume you are a recruiter and two different people approach you for a job. One tells you a lot of stories of what they can do and what they have done without showing you any evidence.
Then, the other person tells you what they are capable of and presents you with some of the projects they have completed before. Who are you most willing to give the job?

Show; donâ€™t tell.

If you are a self-taught programmer, then you need to be the person that does a lot of showing their worth rather than the one that talks a lot.
Be the person that you think recruiters will be willing to employ and invite to that interview. Showcase a lot of your work, and convince interviewers with your GitHub projects.

**2. Shows your Diligence and Passion.**

Apart from showcasing your projects, GitHub can also be a better metric of measuring how passionate you are about programming.
With the GitHub commit graphs, one can easily see your commit history and activity. Since this can be a gamer changer in one way, it does not necessarily mean that committing daily to GitHub makes you a better programmer.
On the other hand, what it does is show the recruiters how passionate you are about programming. Committing your changes shows that you are doing some coding and making some progress with your learning.

**3. The Community**

GitHub is an open-source platform and custodian of the Open Source Community, and the community is really what fuels it. There are millions of programmers and hobbyists that download, review, and evaluate each other's work.
Moreover, GitHub is the platform of choice for developers from various large corporations, too. Microsoft is the number one contributor to the system, but there are also Google, SAP, AirBnB, IBM, PayPal, and many others.

**4. Version Control.**

We've already talked about it before but it's worthy to mention it again. Versions control on GitHub works much like on MS Office or Google Drive â€” it tracks all the changes made to your code and who makes them. You can always review the detailed changelog that neatly hosts all of the relevant information.
Having such a version history is a must when you collaborate with someone on the same project. Especially when the number of contributors surpasses double digits.

**5. Showcases Your Work**

It's not uncommon to see developers use their Github Profile as their potfolio.
Whether it's to store your projects, contribute to another project or showcase your works, Github caters to all of that.
When it comes to applying for jobs, it may be difficult for self-taught programmers to convince the recruiters that they can program and have the relevant skills.
This is where GitHub kicks in. GitHub provides a similar experience as a store where you house your projects and codes.
It is completely free to do that and on top of all this, your projects can be viewed by anyone if it is a public repository.
Since most recruiters are most interested in what you can do than what you know, having a GitHub profile with some projects can be a huge game-changer for you if you are job hunting.
It quickly aligns and shows the recruiter what you are capable of and what you can do for them.

**6. Integrations**

From apps that connect GitHub to your Amazon and Google Cloud accounts, to project management tools, the platform provides a huge choice of integrations for code review automation, continuous integration, code performance and error monitoring, and task management.
Most developer-focused apps use Github to authenticate or create accounts for you, eliminating the need to manage multiple accounts.
