## Github Education

Github Education is a non-profit part of Github that caters to students. They provide student developers with the resources, called the Github Student Developer Pack, which contains what they need to get started effectively in the Tech ecosystem with support from partner organisations as Microsoft, Namecheap, .Tech Domains and Name.com for domain names, DigitalOcean for web hosting, Twillo for Communication APIs, Canva pro for creating designs and so much more. You'll never really be able to exhaust the benefits.

The Student Developer Pack as the name implies is only available to students with a valid means of identifying themselves as a student. Go the [website](https://frda.me/dev-pack) to sign up and get yours.
