The goal of this course is help you understand commonly used terms about Github. ðŸš€

### Repository

At the heart of Github is repositories. It's the basics for all other actions in Git and Github. A repository is your project folder that is git enabled. By this, I mean your project folder or codebase is not a repository untill you have enabled Git in it. To do that you musthave Git installed on your laptop and either use the Command prompt for Windows Os or Terminal for Linux/Mac OS users to initialize Git in your Project folder/codebase. If you use Viscual Studio Code, you can use the in-editor terminal. For an In-depth guide on how to do that, go [here](./set_up.md). When you initialize Git in your Projecct folder or Codebase, Git creates a hidden folder in the Project Folder now called a repository. The repository tracks all changes to build a history over time. All this changes are tracked and stored locally in your machine. If there are a number of people working on one Codebase, each of them would have a local copy of the Repository on their Computer and all of them would use the Remote Repository (explained below) as a source of truth or Central repository to keep track of the project and what the other is doing.

### Remote
This is also known as "Remote Repository". It is a git repository hosted on the internet. After using git to initialize a repository to track project changes on your local machine, you can equally create a repository on Github hosted on the internet. Git enables us to link the repository present in our local machine to the repository hosted on the internet allowing `push` and `pull` actions with the remote project.

This has alot of advantages, one major advantage is that it stores your project on the internet, now you can access and make changes to your project with or without the computer you used to start the project. 

### Branching
Branching is how git enables multiple developers to collaborate and work on a project by modifying the working codebase. When you create a branch, git creates a different codebase where you can make changes and modify files without affecting the main codebase which is usually on the main branch. A branch can be created using the terminal by running `git branch <new_branch_name>`.A branch can be created to fix a bug, work on a new feature, test out a way of doing something or whatever. After work is done on the branch, it is then merged (explained below) into the main branch and can either be deleted or continued to be used by the developer.

### Merging
Once youâ€™ve completed work on your branch, you can decide to merge it with the main branch. Merging simply means updating the main branch with changes from another branch in the same repository. When the `git merge <branch_name>` command is run, git scans through your branch for changes and updates the main (main branch) with found changes.

### Merge Conflicts
Sometimes merging a branch to the main isn't as straight forward as writing a single command on the terminal. In a scenerio where two developers are working on the same file in a project from different branches, the first merge from the first branch might have no conflict but when you try to merge the second branch, there will be a merge conflict especially when both branches modified the same file. Reason for the conflict is that git doesn't know which version of the file to keep. Everytime there's a merge conflict, git shows you every line of code that has a conflict and you'll have to manually decide which part of the code stays and which goes. While resolving merge conflict on the terminal, it is important that you delete the merge markers along side the unwanted code.

### Issues
GitHub Issues is a lightweight issue-tracking system that is available in all GitHub repositories. It is a simple tool that allows you to track your progress, keep a task list, collect feedback, and report bugs for your GitHub hosted project.

* Creating an Issue.<br>
  To create an Isuue, go to the issues tab and click on ```New Issue```
  <img src="https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/github-issues/new-issue.jpg" />
  
  Then in the Write section, describe in detail what the problem is about. Once you are done, click on ```Submit new Issue```
  
  <img src="https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/github-issues/write-issue.jpg" />
  
  You can tag people in Issues or assign them so that they are aware you are requesting help, add labels to keep issues organised, assign Issues to Projects, add links, make refereneces to file, to a line or lines of code and even add images. Issues support Markdown, which is what makes all of these possible. (Markdown is what this file is written in and what everything in this learning material for the Bootcamp is written in, so you can see that it's powerful.)

By default, Issues are not enabled on forked repositories but they can be enabled in the repository settings.

### Fork 
There is no git fork command. From the command line you can clone a Git repo, you can pull from a Git repo and you can fetch updates from a Git repo, but there is no git fork command if youâ€™re working with a standard Git installation.
A fork in Git is simply a copy of an existing repository in which the new owner disconnects the codebase from previous repository.
Any public Git repository can be forked or cloned. A fork creates a completely independent copy of Git repository. In contrast to a fork, a Git clone creates a linked copy that will continue to synchronize with the target repository.

In summary, a fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes and/or continue working without affecting the original project.
Most times, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the orginal remote repository. 

In order to properly fork a repository, you have to first fork that repo on github then clone it to your computer so that you can work on it locally and make changes. 

1.  First go to the repo you want to fork and click on fork

2.  If you are a member of Organisations with collaborative access, you'll be asked where you want to fork it to, if not it work create a fork immediately.
3.  From there, clone the repo by clicking on ```Code``` and click the **copy** icon to cpoy the reomte url link you can use to clone the repo to your computer. ( See Cloning )

### Pull Requests
A pull request â€“ also referred to as a merge request â€“ is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository. It's called a pull request because you're asking the project to pull changes from your fork.
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. 

You can only create pull requests on GitHub.com, with GitHub Desktop, in Codespaces, on GitHub Mobile, and when using GitHub CLI. 

Always Pull before a Push and Pull request. If you are working one a project with others, or generally by best practices, it is adviced to always pull from a remote repository before pushing and creating a pull request. Doing so will ensure that your local copy is in sync with the remote repository. Remember, some other people have been pushing to the remote copy, and if you push before syncing up, you could end up with multiple heads or merge conflicts when you push.
